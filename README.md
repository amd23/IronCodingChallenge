# Old Phone Pad Coding Challenge

## Overview
This project simulates text input using an old mobile phone, where multiple keypresses determine the selected letter. It includes a console-based application and NUnit tests for validation.

## How It Works
- The program interprets number key presses based on mobile text input rules.
- The user enters a sequence ending with `#`.
- `*` is used to delete the last entered character.

## Setup & Installation
### 1. Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-repository/OldPhonePadCodingChallenge.git
cd OldPhonePadCodingChallenge
